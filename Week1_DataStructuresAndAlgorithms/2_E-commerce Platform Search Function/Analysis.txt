Linear Search checks items one by one. Time grows linearly with the number of elements.

Binary Search repeatedly splits the list in half. Time grows logarithmically — very efficient.

We use Binary Search if:

1. Your data is already sorted, or you can sort it once and search many times.

2. You want things to be fast, especially if there are a lot of items.

We use Linear Search if:

1. Your data is not sorted, and you don’t want the extra work of sorting.

2. The list is short, or you only need to search once or twice.

3. You want a quick and simple solution.
